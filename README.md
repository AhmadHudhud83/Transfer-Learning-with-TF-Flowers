This project applies transfer learning techniques using pre-trained ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 models to classify flower images from the TF Flowers dataset. By fine-tuning selected layers or blocks of each model, the project aims to achieve high classification performance on a relatively small dataset while comparing the efficiency and accuracy trade-offs between the two architectures.
